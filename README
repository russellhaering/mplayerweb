*    MPlayerWeb   *
*******************

Description:
    A simple and remarkably feature-less way of browsing media and launching
    mplayer from a web interface.

Dependencies:
    Python (tested in 2.6)
    Twisted Web
    MPlayer

Setup:
    1. Modify MEDIA_PATH to point to your videos
    2. Run 'twistd -noy mplayerweb.py', browse to http://localhost:9001 and
       make sure everything is working.
    3. To daemonize the app, run with 'twistd -oy mplaywerweb.py'

Note: I think this will leave a bunch of mplayer processes lying around, in the
      future I may clean this up and add an actual 'remote control' interface.
